              <h2>Season 2: 2008–2009</h2>
              <p>The second season mainly explores the senior year of the characters with the premiere at the Hamptons and primarily focused on the relationship between Blair and Chuck, who were labeled "the heart of GG" by People magazine.[11] At first, both characters deny their feelings for one another, and go through various schemes and manipulations. The first half of the season deals with Serena's growing prominence as a socialite and the rift it creates between her and Blair. The second half of the season reveals the impact of Bart's death. As the storylines progressed, the role of "Gossip Girl" is slightly decreased. She continues to run her blog, but she keeps the ultimate information for herself, sending it in the final episode as the last blast, where Serena decides to find out who "Gossip Girl" really is, but ultimately fails. The season finale ended with a well-received kiss between Blair and Chuck.
