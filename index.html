                      <br>
                      <p><span>Gossip Girl</span> is an American teen drama television series based on the novel series of the same name written by Cecily von Ziegesar. Developed for television by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, it was broadcast on The CW network for six seasons from September 19, 2007, to December 17, 2012.
                        Narrated by the unknown, omniscient blogger "Gossip Girl", the series revolves around the lives of privileged upper-class adolescents living in Manhattan's Upper East Side. The series begins with the return of Upper East Side teenage "it girl" Serena van der Woodsen from a mysterious absence. She is reunited with her frenemy Blair Waldorf and her mother Lily, and she also meets Dan Humphrey — an aspiring writer from Brooklyn who is one of Serena's main love interests throughout the show. Other main characters include Nate Archibald, Chuck Bass, Jenny Humphrey, Vanessa Abrams, Rufus Humphrey and Ivy Dickens.</p>
